                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am Belal Shebl, a computer science student at King Fahd University for Petroleum and Minerals passionate about AI, cybersecurity, and building technology that solves real-world problems. 
                    Alongside my studies, I have led student initiatives, organized international conferences, and worked on projects ranging from web development to research-focused platforms. 
                    I enjoy combining technical skills with creativity to turn ideas into meaningful digital experiences.

                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <h3>Project 1: Arabic Sign Language to Text Translation using Deep Learning</h3>
                <p>Developed an AI-based translation system that converts Arabic Sign Language gestures into written Arabic text. 
                    The model leverages sequence-based deep learning architectures, including LSTMs and Transformers, to capture temporal motion patterns and contextual relationships between gestures. 
                    This project focuses on improving accessibility by bridging communication gaps between the deaf community, the Arabic text-based digital systems, and people who do not know sign language.

                <h3>Project 2: Blockchain-Based Smart Contract for Secure Supply Chain Transactions</h3>
                <p>Designed and deployed a smart contract on the Ethereum Sepolia test network to model secure and transparent supply chain transactions. 
                    The system uses blockchain principles and cryptographic mechanisms to ensure data integrity, traceability, and trust between parties without relying on a central authority. 
                    This project demonstrates the application of decentralized security and blockchain technology to real-world logistical workflows.
